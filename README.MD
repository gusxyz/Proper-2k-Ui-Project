 # Proper 2K UI Project - Gus Edition

A fork of LuvianQ's original 2k UI project, made this to fix some overlapping text issues I was having.


LuvianQ's CREDITS:

Enjoy

goondo for their Scale\_UI mod. Served as the chief inspiration for the creation of this mod, as well as being a great base for me start analyzing and learning from!

ArtemisFowl for their Artemis UI + Expanded Missions compatability mod!

Sulphur for their UI a la Sulfuris mod - Their work made it a lot easier to incorporate the Banners 5.0 mod which IMO adds an amazing visual touch to the game that I can't go back from!

The many creators of the awesome Expanded Mod Family of mods - Jay DoubleU, Stiopa866, LimonenZitrone, Melvasul, Zwei833 the High Pinger, LordVarangian, ComradDoge, Viking\_Nephilim, Silver Knight of Anor Londo, Fly\_Pepper, Vicryl, ChuKoNoob, Catoscar, UberEpicZach, Lumisentius, and anyone else that I might've missed xD!

Many of the wonderful people in the EU4 Mod Coop discord who helped with any modding questions I had as I learned!
